## TYPESCRIPT 
- This README provides an introduction to the TypeScript project and how to get started using it.

## What is TypeScript?

* TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. This means you can define the data types of variables, functions, and other elements in your code. TypeScript code is then compiled into regular JavaScript that can run in any browser or environment that supports JavaScript.

## Setup

- Command Line Compiler (tsc): Install the TypeScript compiler globally using npm install -g typescript and then use the tsc command to compile your TypeScript files.
- IDE Integration: Many popular IDEs like Visual Studio Code and WebStorm offer built-in support for TypeScript, providing type checking and other features directly within the IDE.

## Initializing a project
- create a folder.
- mkdir build/index.html src/main.ts
-  tsc --init
-  Regiser the ./root{ ./src } and outDir{ ./build/js} on the config file
